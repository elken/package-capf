* Install
** Manual
Download somewhere and add to your =load-path= and add =package-capf= to =completion-at-point-functions=.
** TODO Doom
Add the following lines to your relevant files

=packages.el=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! package-capf
  :recipe (:host github :repo "elken/package-capf"))
#+end_src

=config.el=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! package-capf
  :after cape
  :hook (emacs-lisp-mode . (lambda ()
                             (make-local-variable 'completion-at-point-functions)
                             (add-to-list 'completion-at-point-functions #'package-capf))))
#+end_src

* Configuration
The following options are available to customise:
** =package-capf-always-refetch=
By default, for obvious reasons, we don't update the list of available packages every time the completion is invoked. If this is desired, set this to be non-nil (and ensure your internet connection is able to handle it)
** =package-capf-annotation=
Specify the annotation to use (defaults to  ïƒ„ )
** =package-capf-completion-symbols=
A list of symbols to run the completion against.

Will use this list to check if the current line contains the start of a valid recipe
